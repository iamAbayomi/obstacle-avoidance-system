/*******
 This is the code for smoke detecting system. The idea behind this code was gotten from 
 https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Aritro/smoke-detection-using-mq-2-gas-sensor-79c54a?utm_source=pocket_mylist
 
 Modifications for this code was made to the smoke threshold 
 The smoke threshold was reduced to detect smoke at minute concentrations.
